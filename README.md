## Project Documentation
The project report and documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/bhavesh-gulabani/hcms-v2/blob/master/Documentation/Project%20Report.pdf).

### Note
- As the server is deployed on Heroku, which sleeps after 30 minutes of inactivity, the first request may take some extra time (5-10 secs).  
- After the initial request the application will run without any delay.
